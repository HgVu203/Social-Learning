# Game Background Images

This folder contains background images for the educational games. Currently, these files are just placeholders and need to be replaced with actual images.

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG or PNG (JPG recommended for photos)
- **Resolution**: At least 1280x720px (16:9 ratio) recommended
- **File size**: Keep under 300KB for optimal loading performance

## Required Images

1. `code-bg.jpg` - Background for Coding Challenge game (programming/coding related)
2. `math-bg.jpg` - Background for Math Puzzles game (mathematics/numbers related)
3. `quiz-bg.jpg` - Background for Tech Quiz game (technology/quiz related)

## Tips for Good Background Images

- Choose images with soft details that won't distract from the text/UI elements
- Images with darker tones work well with the gradient overlays
- Abstract or pattern-based images often work better than detailed photographs
- Consider the target audience when selecting images

Remember that the images will have color gradients applied over them in the application, so they don't need to match the game colors perfectly.
